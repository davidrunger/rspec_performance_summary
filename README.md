# You don't need this gem!

Instead, use RSpec's [`config.profile_examples`][profile_examples] option (which I was not aware of when I wrote this gem ðŸ™ƒ).

[profile_examples]: https://rspec.info/features/3-13/rspec-core/configuration/profile/

# RspecPerformanceSummary

Print the execution time of your slowest RSpec examples.

# Installation

Add the gem to the `test` group of your application's `Gemfile`. Because the gem is not released via
RubyGems, you will need to install it from GitHub.

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec_performance_summary', require: false, # we'll require it manually in `spec_helper.rb`
    git: 'https://github.com/davidrunger/rspec_performance_summary.git'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Finally, add this to the `spec/spec_helper.rb` file in your project:
```rb
require 'rspec_performance_summary'
```

# Usage

Just run one or more of your RSpec tests! The performance summary should be printed automatically
after the tests have completed.

# Credit

I borrowed this code for the performance logging from
https://coderwall.com/p/l3nl_w/measure-spec-execution-time .

I borrowed the general code approach for plugging into RSpec from a gem from
[rspec-retry](https://github.com/NoRedInk/rspec-retry).

# Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` to
run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

# For maintainers

To release a new version, run `bin/release` with an appropriate `--type` option, e.g.:

```
bin/release --type minor
```

(This uses the `release_assistant` gem.)

# License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT
License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
